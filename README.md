## Prisoner's Dilemma

This project simulates the simple game with candy, where there is a machine that
controls the supply of candy for two groups of people based on whether 
one or both of two operators put one in it:

|  | Both cooperate | 1 cheats, 2 cooperates | 1 cooperates, 2 cheats | Both cheat |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Operator 1 | +2 candy | +3 candy | -1 candy | 0 candy |
| Operator 2 | +2 candy | -1 candy | +3 candy | 0 candy |

So, if everyone is cooperating and puts candy in a machine as agreed,
everyone gets a reward. But both participants also have a temptation to
cheat and only pretend to put a candy into machine, because in this case
their group will get 3 candy back, just taking one candy from a second
group. The problem is, if both operators decide to play dirty, then nobody
will get anything.

## Behavior types

This project uses 5 models of behavior:

| Behavior type | Player Actions                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cheater       | Always cheats                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Cooperator    | Always cooperates                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Copycat       | Starts with cooperating, but then just repeats whatever the other guy is doing                                                                                                                         |
| Grudger       | Starts by always cooperating, but switches to Cheater forever if another guy cheats even once                                                                                                          |
| Detective     | First four times goes with [Cooperate, Cheat, Cooperate, Cooperate],  and if during these four turns another guy cheats even once -  switches into a Copycat. Otherwise, switches into Cheater himself |

## Project Requirments

Need to model a system with seven
classes - `Game`, `Player` and five behavior types (subclassed from `Player`).

Here, `registry` is used to keep track of the current number of candy
during the game, while `player1` and `player2` are instances of 
subclasses of `Player` (each being one of 5 behavior types). Calling 
`play()` method of a `Game` instance should perform a simulation
of a specified number of matches between players of a given behavior.

Method `top3()` should print current top three player's behaviors
along with their current score.

By default, code when run should simulate 10 matches (one call of
`play()`) between every pair of two players with *different* behavior
types (total 10 rounds by 10 matches each, no matches between two
copies of the same behavior) and print top three winners after the 
whole game.
